sentences.case1 = "I previously owned a Pentax PZ10 35mm camera and have shot with several point and shoot digitals. \
I missed the flexibility of shooting in shutter or exposure override. \
Had several Pentax zoom lenses I didn't want to part with. \
This camera has been easy to learn, and with the higher pixel count on the LCD I can see in even high sun situations. \
While not as extensive in scene mode as other DSLR's, there are enough selections to make it so you don't miss a shot. \
Only negative is the software Pentax ships with the camera, it is difficult to use and not very intuitive. \
That said, most of us already have a favorite photo utility that we use. \
I would highly recommend the dual lens kit. \
The 55-300 lens is easy to keep on the camera during a hike and allows me to catch those mid range distance shots."

It streams well and loads blu-ray discs fast. \
My PS3 is definitely thanking me for getting this. \
It is getting a much deserved rest now."

sentences.case3 = "Here are some various tidbits that are not really listed in the product description\: - Bezel is GLOSSY, Screen is MATTE (very happy, I dont see reflections\!) - Stand plastic and is not adjustable at all. No vertical tilting, or even horizontal tilt. Definitely the worst part about the TV - Game Mode turns off most image enhancement but cuts down on Input Lag. I play fighting games that require 1-frame links (inputs within 1/60 of a second). This TV is fast in game mode and should not hurt your gameplay - Sound quality is mediocre/average at best. They are TV speakers, so you shouldn't expect much - An IR receiver sits blatantly on the bottom-right hand corner of the bezzle. It is a small bump on the bottom of the screen. Rather than put the IR receiver on the bezel or behind the screen, it makes the unit look cheap...so samsung can save a few bucks on each unit - Happy to report no overscan/underscan issues on PC/PS3. i didnt have to make any adjustments to fill the screen correctly - No VGA input. Only Two HDMI and One Component input. Could be a problem if you want to connect a console, blu-ray, and a computer if you only have HDMI connections. You would need a receiver or switcher obviously. - NON STANDARD POWER BRICK. It is rated 14v @ 2.5a. This means max power consumption should be 35W. Energy star rating of $4 / year. Could be a real hassle if the power brick decides to go. Probably need to get a samsung brick, since 14V is not really common\!\! Hope this helps someone. I bought this TV without knowing these things, but I am glad it worked out for me. I use it as a console gaming monitor in my office next to my main PC"
