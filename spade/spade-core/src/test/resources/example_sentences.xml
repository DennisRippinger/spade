I've tried others and am always confused by the menus... although could just be what you're used to.
This camera has been great though.
Even though it's an older model it does everything I need and then some.
The upgraded ISO and DIGIC is a nice step up from my previous Rebel.
A great full featured but reasonably priced DSLR.]]></data>

I bought this TV two months ago.
About a month ago the TV power button would no longer work.
Sears refused to exchange the TV because I did not take out the extended warranty.
Seiki to date refuses to honor the one year warranty on the TV.
I would never recommend buying a Seiki TV because their customer service is terrible.

I have owned my 30D for over 2 years and approximately 12.000 frames and I am very happy with the camera.
The build is substantial and the features are quite vast.
I like the camera so much that I purchased one for my father for Christmas and he is very pleased with it as well.
I have not had the opportunity to try a 40D other than the camera stores, but I have to say that I am set for a few more years, now I just need to upgrade all my lenses to L Series, but that takes a bit of time and money.
